As a GIT client, I use: https://www.gitkraken.com



 
I have started a git repository on Github from which anyone can download my R-package (in development), suggest edits or point out issues: https://github.com/Silviculturalist/forester
 
I hope that this will become a good digital centre for maintaining our valuable research heritage in the digital era, and will work hand-in-hand with digitization efforts from the SLU library to ensure that source material is not only referenced in the documentation, but in the future actively linked to.

The goal of this github repository to be a centre to:
Digitalise;
Review,  discuss, validate and update functions.
Maintain version control and good documentation;

 
I am continuing to develop object structures for which R will recognize attributes which are related to trees, stand information, site information, and treatment information, such that this may grow into a stand simulator on its’ own.

As work with the package progresses, it is my full intent that this should not be limited to Swedish conditions, but should eventually form an open online repository for functions related to forest science, forestry and related data from all over the world.
 
As such, it will remedy several of the issues I have noticed with earlier stand simulators :
x Documentation of R packages is stricter and more structured.
x Issues can be recognized and solved open-source.
x The user will have full control over all processes (no black-box functionality!)
x The material is less at risk to become obsolete through technical issue.
x Trust in the collection is gradually increased and maintained by its’ transparency.
x The user does not need to use the functions in a fixed setting (e.g. function 1 -> function 2 -> function 3 -> results)
 
 
In general, the git process is as follows:
 
1. Someone lifts an issue. Maybe they want an addition, or have spotted a mistake in the code!
2. The issue is discussed.
3. Someone uploads a suggested remedy.
4.The repository owner (me) or other vetted collaborators review and potentially approve of the new code.
5. Coding and documentation style will be standardized.
6. The main file is updated with the new code, available to all users when they update the package.
 
 
The package includes:
1. Vignettes (lab-instructions and examples for how to use)
2. Functions
3. Documentation (every single function or data is well documented, indexed and searchable and given with examples of use).
4. Data , so far mostly older published.
