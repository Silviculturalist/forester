#'"In chapter 3 a material is analysed, which consists of 680 revisions of both permanent and temporary plots.
#'The only uniform information given about the establishment of the stands in this material is whether the stands
#'are planted or not. Stand age varies in the material between 12 and 260 years, top height between 2.5 and 27.9 meters
#'and stem number per hectare between 173 and 34'917. The material is given in table 3.1. Some important stand variables from each plot and revision are listed in appendix 3.
#'
#'Permanent and temporary plots differ systematically, especially in higher stands.
