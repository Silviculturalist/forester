#' Height trajectories for Norway Spruce in Norway from Tveite 1977
#'
#' @description Based on permanent plot records from the eastern and middle regions of Norway - intended for use in whole country apart from Western regions. Data consists of 128 height/age series of different length. Construction method makes the reference age arbitrary. 40 years typical in Norway. At ages above 100, the ratio between the anamorphic curves is held constant.
#' Not recommended for use on stands younger than 15-20 years of age at breast height.
#' This function returns the regular height trajectories (Equations VII.8 and VII.9)
