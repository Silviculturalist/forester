During the middle of the 19th century, central European foresters based in the germanic *kleinstater* were looking for a metric which reliably could be used to distinguish the productivity of forest stands.

Early estimates of volume were made in the form of

$$
V = Basal~area\times\overline{height}\times Air~percentage~of~Mass 
$$

Examples can be given in, e.g. @jonson1914 . Wherein the air percentage of mass was calibrated roughly from plots run by the Royal College of Forestry.

However, both diameter and mean height are heavily influenced by silvicultural operations, e.g. PCT, thinning.

@fries1964, p. 15, provides a compact introduction to the development of the top height concept.

Up until the time of writing his dissertation (1964), *dominant height* or *top height*, was defined by @näslund1936, p. 48, as the height predicted by the height function at a diameter of $\bar{D} + 3\sigma$ , mean diameter + 3 standard deviations.

> Based on the above definition, Professor Manfred Näslund, late Professor Lars Tirén as well as professors Erik Hagberg, Charles Carbonnier and Bertil Matérn recommended a for practical use more suitable definition: the height according to the height curve for the arithmetic mean diameter of the first tenth of the trees, when these have been ordered after falling diameter at breast height, $h_{10\%}$ . @fries1964

> It has yet to be proven that the height trajectory is valid not only for the thickest diameter, but also for the height for a certain relative amount within a stand, for example the 10% thickest trees' heights. Matérn has conducted such a study, which has not been published:

@fries1964 p. 26 recounts an unpublished study by Professor Bertil Matérn which were announced in a memorandum, @carbonnier1959.

> The study concerns the arithmetic mean diameter for the 50 and 100 thickest trees per ha as well as for the 5 and 10% thickest trees both before thinning during the establishment of the permanent plots (time 1) and at the latest revision (time 2). The study shows that the trees, which at time 2 were among the 5% thickest trees, at time 1 had approximately the same mean diameter as the 5% thickest trees at time 1. The same applies for the 10% thickest trees, but not for the 50 or 100 thickest trees per ha.

Since top height is mostly undisturbed by normal silvicultural operations, by the 1970's, site index had emerged as a concept from which one could distinguish the productivity of a stand by their top height and age at breast height (time to breast height is very variable even on sites with similar productivity as a result of extraneous factors such as browsing by rodents, frost or particularly injurious pests such as fungi, e.g. *Phacidium infestans*).

As stated by @fries1974 , now an Associate Professor at the dept. of forest production at the Royal College of Forestry, site index is a function of the mean height and age of the 100 thickest trees per hectare.

Due to the inherent difficulty and time-consuming process of identifying these trees, in practice site index would be distinguished by sample plots.

-   0.1 ha (17.84 m radius) arithmetic mean height and age at breast height for the thickest 10 trees.

-   0.02 ha (7.98 m radius) - two thickest trees.

-   0.01 ha (5.64 m radius) - thickest tree.

Associated bias was found to be \~1.5% if site index was estimated from plots of size 0.01 ha.

@matérn1976 shows that for a theoretical stand of size 0.1 ha, an relatively unbiased estimate can be achieved by measuring the two thickest trees on one plot of radius 9.317 m (0.027 ha).
